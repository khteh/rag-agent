Instruction:

With the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.

Okay, I will strive to provide accurate answers. Based on the information I have, Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting is becoming a standard technique for task decomposition, where the model is instructed to "think step by step" to break down complex tasks into smaller, simpler steps.

Now I will search for common extensions of the Chain of Thought method.

    query: common extensions of Chain of Thought prompting
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: ground_search

Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting has evolved into various extensions and variations that aim to improve its performance, address specific challenges, and broaden its applicability. Here are some common extensions of Chain of Thought prompting:

*   **Zero-Shot CoT:** This approach leverages the inherent knowledge within models to tackle problems without requiring prior specific examples or fine-tuning. It typically involves adding the phrase "Let's think step by step" to the prompt.
*   **Automatic Chain of Thought (Auto-CoT):** This method automatically generates intermediate reasoning steps, further automating the prompting process. It uses techniques like clustering questions based on semantic similarity to ensure diverse reasoning patterns are covered.
*   **Contrastive Chain-of-Thought:** This extends the standard CoT by providing examples of both positive and negative answers in the context. This helps the model learn what mistakes to avoid, potentially leading to fewer errors.
*   **Multimodal CoT:** Traditional CoT focuses on the language modality. Multimodal CoT incorporates text and vision into a two-stage framework. The first step involves rationale generation based on multimodal information.
*   **Program of Thoughts (PoT):** In Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting, LLMs perform both reasoning and computations. The LLM generates mathematical expressions as a reasoning step and then solves it to get the final answer. However, LLMs are not the ideal candidate for solving mathematical expressions as they are not capable of solving complex mathematical expressions and are inefficient for performing iterative numerical computations. Program of Thoughts (PoT) prompting technique delegates the computation steps to an external language interpreter such as a python to get accurate response.
*   **Tree of Thoughts (ToT):** ToT extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS or DFS while each state is evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.
*   **Graph of Thoughts (GoT):** This extension requires building a graph framework through LLMs. The GoT architecture includes a set of interacting modules consisting of a prompter, parser, scoring module, and controller.
*   **Self-Consistency:** This technique improves performance by sampling multiple, diverse chains of thought for the same problem and then selecting the most consistent answer from these chains.
*   **Active Prompting with Chain-of-Thought:** This involves actively selecting the most informative examples to include in the prompt, which can improve the model's performance and data efficiency.

These extensions demonstrate the ongoing research and development in the field of chain-of-thought prompting, with the goal of enhancing the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models.

### To import CSV into the database:

- Need to copy the files / folder into the pod `/var/lib/neo4j/import`
- `LoadNeo4J.sh` will load `data/Healthcare` into `neo4j-0` pod

### Sample Cypher Queries:

- Visit with id:56:

```
MATCH (v:Visit) WHERE v.id = 56 RETURN v;
```

- Which patient was involved in Visit id:56

```
MATCH (p:Patient)-[h:HAS]->(v:Visit) where v.id=56 return v,h,p
```

- Which physician treated the patient i Visit id:56

```
MATCH (p:Patient)-[h:HAS]->(v:Visit)<-[t:TREATS]-(ph:Physician) where v.id=56 return v,h,p,t,ph
```

- All relationships going in and out of Visit id:56

```
MATCH (v:Visit)-[r]-(n) where v.id=56 return v,r,n
```

### Sample Cypher Accumulation:

- Total visits and bill paid by payer Aetna in Texas:

```
MATCH (p:Payer)<-[c:COVERED_BY]-(v:Visit)-[:AT]->(h:Hospital)
WHERE p.name = "Aetna"
AND h.state_name = "TX"
RETURN COUNT(*) as num_visits,
SUM(c.billing_amount) as total_billing_amount;
```
