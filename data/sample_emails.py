    Subject: Re: Project 111232345 - Downtown Office Complex Location: Dallas, TX
    During a recent inspection of your construction site at 123 Main
    Street, the following safety violations were identified:
    Lack of fall protection: Workers on scaffolding above 10 feet
    were without required harnesses or other fall protection equipment. 
    Unsafe scaffolding setup: Several scaffolding structures were noted as
    lacking secure base plates and bracing, creating potential collapse risks.
    Inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE): Multiple workers were
    found without proper PPE, including hard hats and safety glasses.
    Required Corrective Actions:
    Install guardrails and fall arrest systems on all scaffolding over 10 feet. Conduct an inspection of all scaffolding structures and reinforce unstable sections. 
    Ensure all workers on-site are provided with necessary PPE and conduct safety training on proper usage.
    Deadline for Compliance: All violations must be rectified by November 10, 2025. Failure to comply may result in fines of up to $25,000 per violation.
    Contact: For questions or to confirm compliance, please reach out to the OSHA regional office at (555) 123-4567 or email compliance.osha@osha.gov.
